# CloudNativePG PostgreSQL images

![Docker Pulls][badge-docker]
![GitHub Actions Workflow Status][badge-build]

This project maintains various [CloudNativePG] PostgreSQL container image
variants with additional extensions. The images are built from CloudNativePG
[PostgreSQL images][cloudnativepg-github] for all supported major and minor
versions of PostgreSQL that are supported by CloudNativePG along with the
specified extension(s), and are rebuilt daily as soon as a new CloudNativePG
PostgreSQL image becomes available.

## üê≥ Usage

The images are available on [Docker Hub][docker-hub]:

```shell
czetech/cloudnativepg-postgresql:<POSTGRESQL_VERSION>-<VARIANT_NAME>
```

A `VARIANT_NAME` is one of **currently supported variants:**

| Variant name | Extensions | PostgreSQL |
||||
| [pgmq](variants/pgmq) | [PGMQ] | 14-17 |

If your desired extension is not listed, feel free to open an issue!

A `POSTGRESQL_VERSION` can be specified as either a major version (e.g., `17`)
or a minor version (e.g., `17.1`), with the optional addition of an OS name
`bullseye` or `bookworm` (e.g., `17-bullseye` or `17.1-bullseye`). For more
details, refer to [the list of CloudNativePG images][cloudnativepg-registry].

There is no `latest` tag (as an image requires a specified variant). Example
usage for PostgreSQL 17 with the PGMQ extension:

```shell
czetech/cloudnativepg-postgresql:17-pgmq
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build a variant

Each variant has its own Dockerfile located in the `variants/<VARIANT_NAME>`
directory. These Dockerfiles accept the optional `POSTGRESQL_VERSION` or
`POSTGRESQL_DIGEST` arguments, along with others (see the specific Dockerfile
for details).
